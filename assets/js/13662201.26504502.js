If an object has no valid renderers, then a Highlight Proxy is used based on the first collider on the object. The Highlight Proxy will copy the transform values of the original mesh and also apply the collider size and scale to make it appear that the collider is being highlighted. The HighlightManager is used to visualize the results from the PlayerRaycaster system. There is no set limit to the number of objects that can be highlighted, but only 2 objects are expected to be highlighted at once through ClientSim, one object per player hand.

The first is to check all position-synced objects to verify they are above the respawn height. If they fall below the respawn height, they are respawned to their start position or destroyed, depending on the settings in the SceneManager. The second function is to ensure objects have the correct owners when a player leaves.

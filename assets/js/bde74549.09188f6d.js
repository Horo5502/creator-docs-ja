Addresses [this Canny post](https://feedback.vrchat.com/udon/p/arraysort).\\r\\n    - `System.Random` allows Udon to create deterministic random seeds, as well as random Bytes and Doubles, extending the possibilities for randomness in Udon Worlds beyond what `UnityEngine.Random` can do. We exposed 4 new functions, addressing [this Canny post](https://feedback.vrchat.com/udon/p/expose-systemrandom).\\r\\n    - `System.Text.StringBuilder` allows Udon to build and reformat strings with better performance than the existing string functions. We exposed 18 new functions and properties, addressing [this Canny post](https://feedback.vrchat.com/udon/p/please-expose-stringbuilder).\\r\\n    - `System.Text.RegularExpressions` - [RegEx](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex?view=net-8.0) is a powerful system for searching, matching and replacing patterns within strings of text. We exposed 14 new functions and properties, addressing [this Canny post](https://feedback.vrchat.com/udon/p/feedback-expose-systemtextregularexpressions-namespace).\\r\\n    - `System.Type` allows Udon to interact with data types, and can be useful to advanced creators who want to validate object types at runtime. We exposed 67 new functions and properties, addressing [this Canny post](https://feedback.vrchat.com/udon/p/expose-systemtypeissubclassof-isinstanceoftype-issubclassof-and-basetype)\\r\\n- The SDK now supports \\"Detail Preserving Image Downscaling\\" (DPID) mipmaps, which greatly improve the sharpness of world/avatar textures.\\r\\n    - :warning: We\'re still working on this one! It is currently a BETA feature and requires explicit opt-in via the \\"Settings\\" panel in the SDK control panel.\\r\\n    - DPID replaces the mipmapping algorithm on all textures with the \\"Kaiser\\" filtering algorithm selected. \\"Box\\" filtering is unaffected.\\r\\n        - The SDK build panel already encourages you to enable \\"Kaiser\\" filtering, which in turn now enables DPID.\\r\\n    - Unlike the original algorithm, VRChat\'s version of DPID supports transparency. Enable [Alpha is Transparency](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/texture-type-default.html) to avoid filtering artifacts on the edges of transparent textures.\\r\\n    - The original algorithm implementation was published under BSD 3-Clause (a permissive license like MIT). To \'pay it forward,\' we\'ve released our compute shader version under the same license! You can find it in the SDK: `com.vrchat.base\\\\Editor\\\\VRCSDK\\\\Dependencies\\\\VRChat\\\\Resources\\\\PerceptualMipmapping\\\\PerceptualPostProcessor.compute`.\\r\\n- PhysBone gizmo rendering has been optimized.\\r\\n    - Editor gizmos for PhysBones with non-0 radius setting now render 2-3x faster.\\r\\n    - Editor gizmos of multiple PhysBone components in the hierarchy of the selected object now render 1.5-2x faster.\\r\\n    - Addresses [this Canny post](https://feedback.vrchat.com/avatar-dynamics-reports-and-feedback/p/1181-many-physbone-gizmos-lag-editor).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes & Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- The SDK now blocks avatars containing particle systems or trail renderers set to destroy themselves when they finish. Particle systems on the avatar\'s root that disable themselves when they finish are also not allowed.\\r\\n- Fixed typo in the Expression Parameters inspector showing used memory as bytes rather than bits.\\r\\n- Fixed SDK Control Panel setting scripting defines every IMGUI redraw (improves performance slightly).\\r\\n- Improved Lightprobe Hack behavior in situations with lots of ambient lighting.\\r\\n- Fixed how empty expression parameter lists are filled with default parameters. Expression parameter lists can be empty again.\\r\\n- Removed internal warning messages related to PhysBone and Constraint Burst jobs sometimes appearing when opening a project or recompiling scripts.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes & Changes to DPID in `3.7.1-beta.2`\\r\\n\\r\\n- Fixed `alphaIsTransparent` over-emphasising incorrect details.\\r\\n- Fixed non-sRGB textures (e.g. normal maps) diverging at higher mip levels.\\r\\n    - This should now be consistent with sRGB behavior.\\r\\n- Fixed edge cases where a single fully-transparent pixel would get counted when the others are all the same color.\\r\\n- Fixed null reference exceptions being spammed in the log when importing SDK 3.7.1 for the first time.\\r\\n    - DPID is now correctly applied to all mipmaps that previously used Kaiser.\\r\\n- Simplified and streamlined the compute shader.\\r\\n- Reduced DPID-related log spam.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes & Changes to DPID in the final version\\r\\n\\r\\n- Marked DPID as \\"BETA\\" and switched to opt-in.\\r\\n- Set \\"conservative mode\\" to be the default, since it seems to give better results overall.\\r\\n- Fixed normal maps (again).\\r\\n- Fixed support for lightmaps.\\r\\n- Support DPID mipmaps on HDR and Float format textures.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Known Issues\\r\\n\\r\\n- The first time you open a Scene and select a GameObject inside a prefab with a U# Behaviour, the GUI for the component directly below that U# Behaviour will not show its GUI.

You can close it by right-clicking and selecting \\"Close.\\"\\r\\n    - We published [AI Navigation documentation for VRChat Worlds](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/ai-navigation/) and an [AI Navigation Example Scene](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/examples/ai-navigation-example/) to help you get started.\\r\\n- Some Avatar editor panels have been updated:\\r\\n    - The Expression Parameters and Expressions Menu editors have been rebuilt from the ground up.\\r\\n    - The updated Expression Parameters editor:\\r\\n        - Allows you to reorder elements via drag & drop easily\\r\\n        - Uses a progress bar style meter to indicate how many synced bytes the parameters use\\r\\n        - The Expression Parameters assets now have a new icon, making them easier to see in your Assets folder\\r\\n    - The updated Expressions Menu editor:\\r\\n        - Shows the current Menu Controls count alongside the maximum number of Controls you can add\\r\\n        - Shows the types of each Control at-a-glance\\r\\n        - Allows you to reorder the Controls via drag & drop easily\\r\\n        - Has improved and updated warnings and errors\\r\\n        - Has improved layout for editing all the Control types\\r\\n        - For Sub-Menu Controls - allows for quick creation of a new Menu asset and provides a button to open the editor for the submenu with a single click\\r\\n        - The Expressions Menu assets now have a new icon, so they\'re easier to see in your Assets folder\\r\\n- Massively upgraded `Standard Lite` shader!\\r\\n    - Considerably improved performance in the baseline.\\r\\n    - *Non-linear Lightprobe sampling*: This will avoid unusual stark contrast for real-time objects in a scene.\\r\\n    - *Lightprobe specularity*: This will fall back to using lightprobes in the scene to generate specular highlights if no reflection probes are present.\\r\\n    - *Geometric Specular AA*: This will avoid jagged/aliased edges for shiny objects at a distance/at sharp angles by tweaking the roughness to add just enough to stretch any highlights over at least one extra pixel - this should reduce the apparent \'screen door\' effect on a lot of geometry.\\r\\n    - *Spherical Harmonics lightmap compatibility through MonoSH* (Bakery): This allows you to have the appearance of real-time lighting without the cost, by having every pixel of a lightmap encode light spread and direction, and otherwise treating it as being lit that way. The MonoSH version in particular avoids additional memory cost by squeezing everything into just one extra map. Baking MonoSH-compatible lightmaps requires the external Bakery plugin.\\r\\n- Added [OnLanguageChanged](/worlds/udon/graph/event-nodes/#onlanguagechanged) Udon event that gets called on join and when users select a new display language.\\r\\n- Added an info-level message in the SDK build panel that encourages using Kaiser mipmapping for higher clarity.\\r\\n    - We talked about the new DPID mipmapping algorithm [in a dev update](https://ask.vrchat.com/t/developer-update-11-july-2024/25514#mipmapping-experiments-8) before. This is a first step towards that - though the algorithm is not included yet, so this will recommend default Unity Kaiser mips for now.\\r\\n- Added a gizmo to `VRCSceneDescriptor` to visualize the respawn height.\\r\\n- The VRC Scene Descriptor now shows a gizmo in your scene for each spawn defined in the spawns list.\\r\\n- Auto-converting Dynamic Bones components into PhysBones is now required before uploading.\\r\\n- Implemented some new player state APIs available via Udon:\\r\\n    - event [`OnPlayerSuspendChanged(VRCPlayerApi player)`](/worlds/udon/graph/event-nodes/#onplayersuspendchanged)\\r\\n    - event [`OnMasterTransferred(VRCPlayerApi newMaster)`](/worlds/udon/networking/network-components#onmastertransferred)\\r\\n    - [`VRCPlayerApi Networking.Master { get; }`](/worlds/udon/networking/network-components#networking-properties)\\r\\n    - [`VRCPlayerApi Networking.InstanceOwner { get; }`](/worlds/udon/networking/network-components#networking-properties)\\r\\n    - [`bool VRCPlayerApi.isSuspended { get; }`](/worlds/udon/players/#get-issuspended)\\r\\n\\r\\n## VRChat Constraints\\r\\n\\r\\nVRChat Constraints are a full-featured replacement for Unity\'s built-in \\"Constraint\\" components. These are available to use on avatars. Existing constraint setups can be auto-converted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the client, all constraints will be auto-converted on load, but it is still recommended to use the SDK option to do so, as it allows direct testing and even further improved performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nVRChat Constraints are supported on Mobile avatars! Check out our updated [performance rank page](/avatars/avatar-performance-ranking-system) for limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nVRChat Constraints also have a few unique features, like native \\"world constraints\\". Go check out [the extensive documentation](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints/) for more info!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Fixed issue with broken input events in ClientSim, addressing [this Canny issue](https://feedback.vrchat.com/admin/feedback/sdk-bug-reports/p/sdk-361-broke-inputgetkey?boards=sdk-bug-reports).\\r\\n- Fixed world uploads failing in some cases when using inline sprites in TextMeshPro labels.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking API Changes\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the minor version bump indicates, `3.7.0` contains breaking changes for user tooling. In particular, all exposed information and APIs related to _DynamicBones_ have been removed without replacement. As uploading with DynamicBones is no longer supported, user tooling should be updated to reflect that and only support PhysBones going forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes & Changes relative to `3.6.2-beta.1`\\r\\n\\r\\nThis supercedes the `3.6.2` series.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Improved stability of the new editor panels.\\r\\n- Fixed some issues displaying code-generated avatar asset files, as many community tools do.\\r\\n- Fixed avatar expression menu missing parameters between SDK upgrades and restarts.\\r\\n- Fixed empty control names being incorrectly overwritten with \\"New Control\\".\\r\\n- Fixed boolean Toggle menu entries not working as expected in-game (toggles created in `3.6.2-beta.1` or `3.6.2-constraints.4` may need to be recreated).\\r\\n- Sub-assets of expression menus will now copy the target parameter object from the root asset if set.\\r\\n- Fixed network IDs not being displayed in the Scene Descriptor inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes & Changes in `3.7.0-beta.2`\\r\\n\\r\\n- Fixed inconsistent loading of Expression Menu and Parameter icons in editor.\\r\\n- Fixed issue that caused Diffuse and BumpedDiffuse mobile shaders to appear all white.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Constraints Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Fixed rotation constraints locked in exactly one axis sometimes appearing at the wrong rotation. (Woo, gimbal lock.)\\r\\n- Fixed parent constraints potentially shifting in the SDK when Activate is pressed.\\r\\n- Improved stability for constraints that reference one another in a loop.\\r\\n- Fixed more issues with super-low weight constraints.\\r\\n- Fixed offsets not always being calculated correctly for unlocked VRChat position constraints.\\r\\n- Made corrections to how aim and look-at constraints behave when they are solving in local space.\\r\\n- Fixed constraint sources losing their references when selecting multiple VRChat constraints and editing their sources lists at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Improved support for community made tools interacting with the constraints auto-converter in the SDK.\\r\\n    - Please refer to [our documentation](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints/#editor-tooling-info) for more info.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes & Changes in the final version\\r\\n\\r\\n- Further adjustments to the exposed API for constraints. Refer to the [constraints documentation](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints/#editor-tooling-info) for more info.\\r\\n    - This includes a parameter to indicate if a conversion was triggered by clicking \\"Auto-Fix\\".\\r\\n- Improved parameter assignment for submenus in the expression menu editor.\\r\\n- Fixed incorrect LFS references in .dylib files.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Known Issues\\r\\n\\r\\n- The first time you open a Scene and select a GameObject inside a prefab with a U# Behaviour, the GUI for the component directly below that U# Behaviour will not show its GUI.

Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nAdds DataContainers, PhysBones 1.1 (\'Squishy PhysBones\'), AsyncGPUReadback, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Features\\r\\n\\r\\n- **DataContainers!** Lists, Dictionaries and JSON for Udon!\\r\\n    - Added DataLists and DataDictionaries, giving Udon functionality similar to Lists and Dictionaries.\\r\\n        - Lists and dictionaries typically need to support Generics, and Udon does not support them, so this is being done by putting your data into DataTokens first, which are able to store any value.\\r\\n    - Added VRCJSON, a helper class that can convert JSON strings (such as those received from [Remote String Loading](/worlds/udon/string-loading) to and from DataLists and DataDictionaries.\\r\\n    - [Read the Data Containers / VRCJSON docs page](/worlds/udon/data-containers) to learn more.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **AsyncGPUReadback!** This allows you to read back data from GPU and shaders without a heavy performance cost\\r\\n    - Adds the `VRCAsyncGPUReadback.Request` function and corresponding `OnAsyncGpuReadbackComplete` event\\r\\n    - These read data from the GPU into CPU memory without too much of a performance impact, at the expense of delaying the data for one or more frames\\r\\n    - Check the [ASyncGPUReadback](/worlds/udon/vrc-graphics/asyncgpureadback) docs for more info.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Squishy PhysBones!** You can now implement PhysBones that can \\"squish\\" or compress instead of stretch!\\r\\n    - To set up a Squishy PhysBone, swap your PhysBone component to version 1.1 and adjust the \\"Max Squish\\" value.\\r\\n    - **All PhysBones are now versioned!** You can change the version in the PhysBone component. This is being done to allow us to add new features safely.\\r\\n        - Old PhysBones are on Version 1.0 automatically.\\r\\n        - Squishy PhysBones features are on Version 1.1. There are some other changes documented below.\\r\\n        - **All versions will be maintained.** 1.0 is not being deprecated but it is feature-locked and will not have new features added. Any time we add a new \\"breaking\\" feature, we will increment the version.\\r\\n    - PhysBones 1.1: **Gravity and Stiffness act differently and require new values if you are upgrading from 1.0.**\\r\\n        - Gravity is now the ratio of how much the bones should point straight up/down in world space when at rest.\\r\\n        - Stiffness is now the ratio of how much a bone attempts to stay in its previous orientation.\\r\\n        - Previously, these values were direct forces that you needed to balance with the Pull factor. We believe this should be more direct and easier to use.\\r\\n        - These changes were also necessary to support the new functionality added to the component.\\r\\n    - PhysBones 1.1: **Max Squish value has been added.** This is a percentage of how much a bone can shrink.\\r\\n        - The `_Squish` parameter has been added. It works similarly to the `_Stretch` parameter.\\r\\n    - PhysBones 1.1: **Stretch Motion value has been added.** This is a ratio of how much motion affects a bone stretching or squishing.\\r\\n    - Categories of values in the VRCPhysBone component UI can now be collapsed.\\r\\n        - Categories also include a Help button which will take you to the online documentation for that subject.\\r\\n    - [PhysBones](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/physbones) documentation will be updated during the Open Beta for PhysBones 1.1 and Squishy PhysBones.\\r\\n- The Network ID Utility now works for PhysBones in avatar projects\\r\\n    - This tool allows syncing PhysBones between avatars on different platforms, even if they have different GameObject hierarchies\\r\\n        - This advanced tool is only useful if your PC and Quest avatars have different hierarchies!\\r\\n        - You don\'t need to worry about this tool if you don\'t know why you\'d do that.\\r\\n    - [See the full docs for more info](/worlds/udon/networking/network-id-utility)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changes since 3.2.0-beta.1\\r\\n- Re-added some public methods that got removed, including `GetOrAddComponent`\\r\\n    - These are marked as `[Obsolete]` now, make sure to migrate away from using them as they will be removed properly at a later date\\r\\n- Fixed some issues with grabbing PhysBones in Unity\\r\\n- PhysBone stretch is no longer clamped\\r\\n    - This restores previous behaviour\\r\\n- DataContainers: Fixed `GetKeys` and `GetValues` returning incorrect values after using `Add`\\r\\n\\r\\n### SDK API Changes\\r\\nWe\'re working on documenting the \\"Public API\\" of the SDK, which will be guaranteed not to change between minor and patch versions. In the meantime, here are things that have changed since 3.1.13:\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Extension Methods\\r\\nWe\'ve moved some extension methods into the VRC.Core namespace.\\r\\nIf you\'re using the `Transform.Reset()` method, you should instead use `VRC.Core.ExtensionMethods.Reset(Transform t)`.\\r\\nHere are the other similar changes you should make:\\r\\n- `Transform.GetHierarchyPath` > `VRC.Core.ExtensionMethods.GetHierarchyPath(Transform t, Transform relativeTransform)`\\r\\n- `Transform.GetShortHierarchyPath` > `VRC.Core.ExtensionMethods.GetShortHierarchyPath(Transform t, Transform relativeTransform)`\\r\\n- `GameObject.GetOrAddComponent` > `VRC.Core.ExtensionMethods.GetOrAddComponent(GameObject go)`\\r\\n- `Type.GetFriendlyGenericTypeName` > `VRC.Core.ExtensionMethods.GetFriendlyGenericTypeName(Type t, bool includeNamespaces)`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Assembly Move\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysBoneGrabHelper moved assemblies, you may need to reference the `VRC.SDK3A` assembly now from your code. [Here is an example fix](https://github.com/BlackStartx/VRC-Gesture-Manager/pull/22).\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Changes not meant for public use\\r\\nAdditionally, we\'ve made some changes to the following classes, which are _not_ considered part of the Public API for the SDK, and you should move away from using them as soon as possible.\\r\\nWe will publish a document listing all the exclusions from our SDK before the end of May.\\r\\n- `ApiCacheEditor`\\r\\n- `VRC.Core.ApiCache`\\r\\n- `VRC.Core.ApiCache.CachedResponse`\\r\\n- `VRC.Core.ApiCache.CacheEntry`\\r\\n- `VRC.Core.ApiFeedback`\\r\\n- `VRC.Core.ApiFile`\\r\\n- `VRC.Core.ApiModel`\\r\\n- `VRC.Core.ApiModel.SupportedPlatforms`\\r\\n- `VRC.Core.APIResponseHandler`\\r\\n- `VRC.Dynamics.PhysBoneManager.Bone`\\r\\n- `VRC.Dynamics.PhysBoneManager.Chain`\\r\\n- `VRC.Dynamics.PhysBoneManager.PhysBoneJob`\\r\\n- `VRC.Dynamics.PhysBoneManager.Pose`\\r\\n- `VRC.Dynamics.VRCPhysBoneBase`\\r\\n- `VRC.SDK3.Dynamics.PhysBone.VRCPhysBoneEditor`\\r\\n- `VRC.Udon.ClientBindings.UdonClientInterface`\\r\\n- `VRC.Udon.Security.UnityEngineObjectSecurityBlacklist`\\r\\n  The UdonManager will have parts that are part of the Public SDK API, but changes were made to \'banlisted\' methods which are not meant to be used directly."},{"id":"release-3-1-13","metadata":{"permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-13","source":"@site/releases/release-3.1.13.md","title":"Release 3.1.13","description":"Summary","date":"2023-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/tags/release"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Momo the Monster","title":"VRChat Developer","url":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster","imageURL":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster.png","key":"momo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"release-3-1-13","date":"2023-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Release 3.1.13","authors":["momo"],"tags":["release"],"draft":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release 3.2.0","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-2-0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 3.1.12","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-12"}},"content":"### Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nFixes compatibility with Avatars 3.0 Manager.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bug Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n* Reverts name of \'hasInitialized\' field in VRC_AvatarParameterDriver to \'initialized\' to avoid breaking any existing packages which expect this field name."},{"id":"release-3-1-12","metadata":{"permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-12","source":"@site/releases/release-3.1.12.md","title":"Release 3.1.12","description":"Summary","date":"2023-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/tags/release"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Momo the Monster","title":"VRChat Developer","url":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster","imageURL":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster.png","key":"momo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"release-3-1-12","date":"2023-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Release 3.1.12","authors":["momo"],"tags":["release"],"draft":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release 3.1.13","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-13"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 3.1.11","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-11"}},"content":"### Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nNew VRCGraphics features for Udon, new avatar performance metrics, and bug fixes.

VRCShader functions will also accept the exact string _AudioTexture to accommodate for the existing widespread community-created AudioLink system"},{"id":"clientsim-release-1.2.2","metadata":{"permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/clientsim-release-1.2.2","source":"@site/releases/clientsim/clientsim-release-1.2.2.md","title":"ClientSim 1.2.2","description":"Summary","date":"2022-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/tags/release"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Momo the Monster","title":"VRChat Developer","url":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster","imageURL":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster.png","key":"momo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"clientsim-release-1.2.2","date":"2022-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ClientSim 1.2.2","authors":["momo"],"tags":["release"],"draft":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release 3.1.8","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-8"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 3.1.7","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-7"}},"content":"## Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Quality-of-Life Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n* Sets Event Camera on any World-Space UI canvases that need them, fixing [ClientSim Issue 30: UI is not interactable when moved into Canvas that has no VRCUIShape script](https://github.com/vrchat-community/ClientSim/issues/30)\\r\\n* Fixed [Issue with Controller Drift] (https://github.com/vrchat-community/ClientSim/issues/1)"},{"id":"release-3-1-7","metadata":{"permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-7","source":"@site/releases/release-3.1.7.md","title":"Release 3.1.7","description":"Summary","date":"2022-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/tags/release"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Momo the Monster","title":"VRChat Developer","url":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster","imageURL":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster.png","key":"momo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"release-3-1-7","date":"2022-8-18","title":"Release 3.1.7","authors":["momo"],"tags":["release"],"draft":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ClientSim 1.2.2","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/clientsim-release-1.2.2"},"nextItem":{"title":"ClientSim 1.1.4","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/clientsim-release-1.1.4"}},"content":"### Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nA few small changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n* Checks Scene Descriptor for null spawns object before trying to get length, fixing issue when adding a Scene Descriptor to your world manually.\\r\\n* Prompts user to save their scene before loading a Sample Scene, fixing [this Canny issue](https://feedback.vrchat.com/sdk-bug-reports/p/switching-to-the-example-scene-deletes-unsaved-changes."},{"id":"clientsim-release-1.1.4","metadata":{"permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/clientsim-release-1.1.4","source":"@site/releases/clientsim/clientsim-release-1.1.4.md","title":"ClientSim 1.1.4","description":"Summary","date":"2022-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/tags/release"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Momo the Monster","title":"VRChat Developer","url":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster","imageURL":"https://github.com/momo-the-monster.png","key":"momo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2022-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"clientsim-release-1.1.4","title":"ClientSim 1.1.4","authors":["momo"],"tags":["release"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release 3.1.7","permalink":"/creator-docs_ja/releases/release-3-1-7"}},"content":"## Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall cleanup release, mostly around World Tests\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n* Hides Menu in Scene View [thanks to Arne-van-der-Lei](https://github.com/vrchat-community/ClientSim/pull/27)\\r\\n* Compresses Textures and Images [thanks to Metamaniac](https://github.com/vrchat-community/ClientSim/pull/32)\\r\\n* Renames ClientSimIssue3RespawnTest Sample to ClientSimSelfTests\\r\\n* Makes Respawn test just a _part_ of SelfTests instead of the whole thing\\r\\n* Updates package version to 1.1.4\\r\\n* Updates Test Sample description and location\\r\\n* Removes #vcc tag from VRC SDK dependencies"}]}}')}}]);

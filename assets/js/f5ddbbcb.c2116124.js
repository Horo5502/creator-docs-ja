Renderers that are disabled, have a null mesh, or are part of a static batch are ignored. If an object has no valid renderers, then a Highlight Proxy is used based on the first collider on the object. The Highlight Proxy will copy the transform values of the original mesh and also apply the collider size and scale to make it appear that the collider is being highlighted. The HighlightManager is used to visualize the results from the PlayerRaycaster system. There is no set limit to the number of objects that can be highlighted, but only 2 objects are expected to be highlighted at once through ClientSim, one object per player hand.
